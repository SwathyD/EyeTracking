# EyeTracking
This project detects the iris using the Java OpenCV libraries. 
The input feed can be from the webcam attached to the PC or a different smartphone through the support app.
The app connects to the desktop using a socket and sends video frames, which are processed in the PC to find the iris position.
This position can be used to approximate the position on the screen where the user is looking.
